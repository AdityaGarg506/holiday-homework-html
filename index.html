<h1>Animation</h1><br>
<p>Animation in Krita is a fun and creative way to make drawings come to life. Krita is a free drawing program that lets you create frame-by-frame animations, just like a flipbook. You can draw each frame on a timeline and then play them to see your character move or tell a short story. It has helpful tools like onion skinning, which lets you see the previous and next drawings to make smoother movements. Krita is a great way for beginners and students to explore animation and learn how cartoons are made!</p>

<p>Krita makes animation easy and exciting for young artists. It lets you create short cartoons by drawing one picture at a time and putting them together to make movement.

Itâ€™s a great way to practice drawing and storytelling while having fun. With Krita, anyone can start learning how real animations are made!</p>
